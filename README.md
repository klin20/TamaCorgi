<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Physical planners are inconvenient since you have to pull out of your bag or find a piece of scrap paper to write your task down. Online ones (Notion, Google Keep, etc) are also inconvenient because people tend to forget about them as they're not really there in an intrusive way (you can easily close out of them) and then you have to remember to open it back up again. Introducing, TamaCorgi, a Google Chrome extension of a tamagotchi but with a pet corgi! To take care of the corgi, check off tasks from your to-do list or complete tasks from your pet with a click of a button and will always be there in your browser.

### Built With

* [Google Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
